Game Boy Assembly Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with GB Z80 output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to byuu, for making the higan emulator, & the bass assembler =D<br />
Please check out higan, a cycle accurate GB Emulator:<br />

<br />
Also thanks to beware & Duo, for helping me with my initial GB development.<br />
I used the GBDEV wiki to help get me started: http://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki<br />
<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.nes) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I am testing on the accurate emulator BGB by beware for development<br />
which has very nice debugger & tools including graphical VRAM viewer:<br />

You can also use GB emulators like higan & the MAME GB Driver.
